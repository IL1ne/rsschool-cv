## Summary
I like to learn something new and keep my technical level up to par with developers.
Now I work as a project manager, and web development is a hobby for me.
In general, I want to learn js in order to use cooler things in my projects, or maybe even to implement some useful online service that everyone could use, and I proudly add it to my resume line.
## Skills (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, methodologies, version control, tools etc.)
## Code examples (LATEST)
## Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds ofsta experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)
## Education (including courses, seminars, lectures, online learning)
## English (elaborate on what kind of practice you had, if any, how long it lasted and so on)
